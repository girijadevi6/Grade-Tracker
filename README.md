Project Explanation: Student Grade Tracker
This project is a Python program designed to help students track their grades and calculate their GPA (Grade Point Average). It uses the Colorama library to enhance the user interface by printing colored text to the console, making the program more engaging and easier to use.

Key Features:
User Interface with Colorama:

The program starts by initializing the Colorama library to enable colored text output in the console. This feature makes the interaction more visually appealing and user-friendly.
Welcome Message:

Upon starting the program, the user is greeted with a welcome message displayed in blue text, setting a friendly and engaging tone.
Input for Number of Subjects:

The program prompts the user to enter the number of subjects they want to track. This input is taken in cyan-colored text for clarity.
Input Grades for Each Subject:

The user is then asked to enter the grades for each subject. Each grade input is displayed in yellow text, making it easy to follow along.
Calculate Total and Average Grade:

As the grades are entered, the program calculates the total sum of the grades.
Once all grades are entered, it calculates the average grade by dividing the total grade by the number of subjects.
Determine GPA:

Based on the average grade, the program determines the corresponding GPA:
A for 90-100
B for 80-89
C for 70-79
D for 60-69
F for below 60
This classification helps the student understand their overall academic performance.
Display Overall Grade Summary:

Finally, the program prints an overall grade summary in green text, showing both the average grade and the corresponding GPA.
Usage Example:
The user starts the program and sees a welcome message.
The user inputs the number of subjects they have.
The user inputs the grades for each subject one by one.
The program calculates the average grade and determines the GPA.
The program displays the average grade and GPA in a summarized format.
